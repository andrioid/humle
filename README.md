# Humle

Composable HTML in pure Go.

The name is Danish for "hops", and also sounds a lot like a drunken person saying "html". I wasn't drunk when I made this, but I might as well have been.

## Warning

This is very much experimental and there's not much in form of escaping behavior yet. So use at your own risk.

### But, why?

I've been experimenting with [D\*](https://data-star.dev) recently and I was missing some of the ergonomics available to me when writing React/TypeScript.

Gomponents is probably the biggest influence here. The idea of using `... Nodes` and `io.Writer` is a great one. The output is easy to read, clean and very composable.

### How is this different?

- Aimed at Tailwind users
- Pluggable attribute merging
- Attempt to re-use interfaces from Go
- Probably slower and more buggy (yet)

## Usage

```go
// TODO
```

### Honorable mentions

- [Templ]
- [Gomponents]
- [Gostar]
